a question of contents published by the <font color="#ff0000">A-T-C</font>

With judgment of the 12th May 1998 - 312 <font color="#ff0000">O 85/98</font>
- The Hamburg regional court decided "on liability for links", that one
has to account through the fixing of a link the contents of the conned <font

prevented only by one distancing oneself from these contents explicitly.<br>
With that we distance ourselves explicitly from all contents of all
conned <font color="#008000">pages|sides</font> on our Internet presence
and these contents do not make us too particular. This explanation is
valid for all links published on our Internet presence and for all
