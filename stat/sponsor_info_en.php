		<b>What is Alp-Transit-Cargo?</b><br>
		<p>Under the keyword "alpine crossing exchange" the project <font
			color="#ff0000">A-T-C.CH</font> (<font color="#ff0000">Alp-Transit-Cargo</font>)
		was launched in 2006. It sold to the <font color="#008000">destination|objective|purpose</font>
		passage-right for the transit countries, freight <font color="#008000">with|in
		the case of</font> the customs declare or to run <font color="#008000">different|other</font>
		applications directly above us near the authorities.<br>
		Furthermore with the offer an Internet service for <font
			color="#008000">moves|removals</font>, transports and empty hold is
		supposed to be created a worldwide community and a global market's..<br>
		<br>
		The train oil port <font color="#008000">purse|stock exchange</font>
		keeps on representing the thought through the co-ordination
		(Optimisation) from shipments (Freights, parceled goods) available
		empty vehicles (free hold) or to shift onto the rail <font
			color="#ff0000">um so</font> the environment to relieve and to reduce
		the costs for the individual one.<br>
		<br>
		If those ones <font color="#008000">captured|entered</font> so
		relevant information in modern Communication-, to be able to flow in <font
			color="#ff0000">Analye-</font> and information technologies pushes
		this project nationally as also internationally onto great interest.<br>
		<br>
		End of <font color="#ff0000">Dez 2006</font> fell after one, intense
		concept and preparation stage the starting shot for the <font
			color="#008000">conversion|implementation|transfer</font> of the
		project. The realisation horizon is about in total 12 months in
		working days.<br>
		<br>
		How is <font color="#ff0000">A-T-C</font> financed?<br>
		For the financing of the <font color="#008000">conversion|implementation|transfer</font>
		of the total project about 1,2 mln CHF were estimated. In the first
		place this amount is spread over the contributions of the by contract
		bound collaborators. When collaborators come into consideration
		excluding organisations on a national level that shows a <font
			color="#008000">close|narrow</font> <font color="#008000">purchase|reference</font>
		to the subject. It is this with the highest priority the national <font
			color="#008000">associations|dressings</font> of the professional
		organisations as well as the authorities.<br>
		<br>
		Why a sponsoring?<br>
		In spite of these personal investments of the collaborators the
		project still requires additional <font color="#008000">averages|means|remedies</font>.
		The financing of experts is affected by that in particular. Without
		expert knowledge the <font color="#008000">danger|threat</font> of the
		failing is unfortunately very much great due to lacking know-how.<br>
		<br>
		Some financial requirements exist also in the <font color="#008000">area|field</font>
		of the communication and information. Next to the actual <font
			color="#008000">project assignment|project work</font> it is to
		inform of his <font color="#008000">intentions|projects</font> and his
		current <font color="#008000">level|state</font> <font color="#008000">at
		home|within the country</font> as abroad constantly necessary to hold
		<font color="#ff0000">A-T-C</font> always presently and to give the
		person concerned on all flat occasion to deal with the project and his
		effects critically and constructively. This is also indispensable for
		the success of the planned project. Also the best planned project
		fails, when the <font color="#008000">standby|willingness</font>,
		whose results implement, is not available and the understanding is
		missing. The <font color="#008000">cost|effort|expenditure</font> that
		must be invested for that it is significant in every case ex ante
		hardly to budgetise, however, since flexibly inquiries and problems
		must be reacted to.<br>
		<br>
		What brings a sponsoring from <font color="#ff0000">A-T-C</font>?<br>
		Again and again individual institutions or organisations signal to
		interest to participate actively during the <font color="#008000">conversion|implementation|transfer</font>
		of <font color="#ff0000">A-T-C</font>. Since the construction of the <font
			color="#ff0000">Projekt-organisation</font> makes it to them
		impossible as collaborators occur, the possibility is offered to an <font
			color="#008000">investment|participation</font> them in the form of
		the sponsoring.<br>
		<br>
		Through the sponsoring the affected company or the affected
		organisation contribute to <font color="#ff0000">A-T-C</font> being
		able to be <font color="#008000">implemented|moved</font> efficiently.
		Furthermore <font color="#008000">he|she</font> demonstrates the will
		and the <font color="#008000">standby|willingness</font> to support
		the <font color="#008000">project aims|project goal|project objective</font>
		actively and to support the idea of <font color="#ff0000">A-T-C</font>.<br>
		<br>
		How does the sponsoring of <font color="#ff0000">A-T-C</font> occur?<br>
		The sponsoring can occur on different kinds. To name but a few
		examples:<br>
		<br>
		Financing of the <font color="#008000">cost|effort|expenditure</font>
		of a or several experts<br>
		Take-over of the costs of events, information meetings, etc.<br>
		(<font color="#008000">Unparticular|Unspecific</font>) financial
		allocations<br>
		Allocations in the form of payments in kind, as<br>
		Translation of documents into <font color="#008000">different|other</font>
		languages of the country<br>
		for the position <font color="#008000">decree|disposal</font> of <font
			color="#ff0000">Lokalitaeten</font><br>
		<font color="#008000">Appropriation|Provision</font> of technical aids<br>
		The sponsor receives a letter confirmation <font color="#008000">about|over</font>
		his made contribution. Where appropriate and according to kind and <font
			color="#008000">extent|range|size|volume</font> of the return service
		also a sponsoring contract can be signed.<br>
		<br>
		Who <font color="#ff0000">kann/soll ND</font> sponsor?<br>
		The sponsoring suits to all enterprises, to institutions, to
		organisations or to persons who support the <font color="#008000">destinations|objectives|purposes</font>
		of <font color="#ff0000">A-T-C</font> openly. These can be persons or
		organisations which already participate in the project without by
		contract controlled financial <font color="#008000">investment|participation</font>.<br>
		<br>
		The sponsoring is supposed to <font color="#ff0000">offen stehen</font>,
		however, also to profit-oriented entities which connect a
		stabilisation of <font color="#008000">their|her</font> goodwill and <font
			color="#008000">their|her</font> visibility to in order to influence
		<font color="#008000">their|her</font> potential positively in a
		growing <font color="#008000">industry|line</font>.<br>
		<br>
		What may the sponsor expect (Return service)?<br>
		Without contrary <font color="#008000">communications|messages</font>
		the name is published on the web site by <font color="#ff0000">A-T-C</font>.
		The sponsor can renounce the publication in writing.<br>
		<br>
		Upon request he can become <font color="#ff0000">Teilhaber/partner</font>
		at <font color="#ff0000">A-T-C</font>.:<br>
		<br>
		Position In the supervisory board.<br>
		contents-related or structural influence onto the project.<br>
		Upon request the publication is complemented around <font
			color="#008000">following|subsequent</font> one:<br>
		<br>
		URL onto the <font color="#ff0000">Hompage</font>.<br>
		Kind and <font color="#008000">height|level</font> of the sponsored
		contribution.<br>
		Upon request and according to occasion sponsors are presented:<br>
		<br>
		In publicly available print-publications of <font color="#ff0000">A-T-C</font><br>
		At events of <font color="#ff0000">A-T-C</font><br>
		The sponsor is informed regularly of the <font color="#008000">level|state</font>
		of the project <font color="#ff0000">A-T-C</font>.<br>
		<br>
		Provided that the sponsored contribution occurred committedly, the
		sponsor has a claim to an <font color="#008000">appropriate|corresponding</font>
		accounting.<br>
		<br>
		If the sponsor takes over the costs of a <font color="#008000">certain|intended</font>
		<font color="#008000">event|reason</font> (Event, information meeting
		etc.), a special advertising space can be made for him possible within
		the framework of the <font color="#008000">event|reason</font>.<br>
		<br>
		What must the sponsor not expect?<br>
		If financial allocations or natural produce should be tied to <font
			color="#008000">appropriate|corresponding</font> conditions
		afterwards explicitly or implicitly, the partnership with the sponsor
		as of now is solved. On spoken <font color="#008000">average|means|remedy</font>
		and no redemption or return duty withstands natural produce.<br>
